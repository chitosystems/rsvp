# rsvp

I want to create an RSVP application where a user can create an event (wedding, celebration, any type of get together) they want to hold. 
The user can send an invite link to people to fill out the RSVP form. Once they successfully RSVP it will subscribe them to reminders and send out notifications every so often as the event date nears. 
The creator of the event will have access to a dashboard to see how many people are coming, how many have declined and maybe some other metrics like who needs special food accommodations or whatnot. 
The event creator can also send out mass notifications to everyone that is RSVP'd if needed for event updates.
